Previous studies showed that transplantation of cultured neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) could improve
functional recovery for various neurological diseases. All rights reserved.
Copyright © 2015 Cognizant Comm.<br>The results showed that cells
from acrylamide-treated neurospheres could be further
differentiated into neurons and glia when acrylamide was
withdrawn from the differentiation medium. The results
suggested that acrylamide-treated neurospheres retain the
differentiation capacity of NSPCs.

<b>Inhibition</b> of Neurosphere-Forming Efficiency
by Acrylamide Correlates With Cell–Cell
Aggregation in Mouse NSPCs

Using live cell imaging microscope observation, we
showed that the cells proliferate with weak cell–cell adhesion

in the neurosphere-forming medium containing 0.5 mM
acrylamide (Fig. The results showed that cells
from acrylamide-treated neurospheres could be further
differentiated into neurons and glia when acrylamide was
withdrawn from the differentiation medium.<br>Furthermore,

These results suggested that the inhibition of neurosphere-
forming efficiency by acrylamide may correlate with
cell–cell adhesion in neurosphere formation. Additionally,
the results from the resphere experiment also provided the
evidence that acrylamide-treated neurospheres regain the
self-renewal property of the NSPCs when acrylamide
is removed.

and MAPKs signaling pathway with c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) and p38
were activated by ACR. Specific inhibitors were used to explore the roles of
MAPKs and NF‐κB pathways in ACR‐induced apoptosis in SH‐SY5Y cells.
Pretreatment with JNK‐specific inhibitors SP600125 markedly upregulated the
reduced B‐cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‐2) content and downregulated the increased
Bcl‐2‐associated X protein (Bax) level and thereby eventually reduced the
proportions of early and late apoptotic cells induced by ACR, while p38
suppression by SB202190 only reversed the decrease in Bcl‐2 expression.
<b>Inhibition</b> of NF‐κB by BAY 11‐7082 markedly upregulated Bax level and
decreased Bcl‐2 expression, and eventually increasing the proportions of
neuronal apoptosis compared with that in ACR alone. In addition, nuclear NF‐κB
and MAPKs signaling pathway with c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) and p38
were activated by ACR.<br>The apoptotic protein expression and
the proportions of apoptotic cells were detected by
Western blot analysis and flow cytometry, respectively.
As shown in Figure 8A, compared with the ACR‐treated
group,
cells pretreated with SP600125 showed a
decreased proapoptotic Bax expression and increased
antiapoptotic Bcl‐2 formation when JNK pathway was
blocked. <b>Inhibition</b> of p38 by SB202190 significantly
enhanced Bcl‐2 expression, but had no significant effect
